# 🔍 `svselect`

Easy to use `Select` inputs.

### Exports the `Select` component:

```ts
options?: Param[];
multiple?: boolean;
allowcreate?: boolean;
onChange?: (
	newValue: Param[] | Param,
	oldValue: Param[] | Param
) => boolean;
selected: Param[] | Param;
```

### Made to fit in with Bootstrap. You should be able to integrate this seemlessly without a styling hassle.
